# HOW-TO:

First, add a repository secret named 'MD_TO_PAGES_ACTION_TOKEN' with write permission, then just write your Markdown text into 'content.md', then push and enjoy. :)  
The workflow will automatically push to gh-pages branch the .html output rendered from the markdown file.  
You can access your new site from <github-username.github>.io/<repo-name>.  
Feel free to use this template.

If you need a Table of Content just add "{TOC}" at the beginning of the file.  
If you want to customize your page title just add "{TITLE} Your title" at the beginning of the file.

An example use is visible at content.md!
